1- Launch bluetooth control:
   sudo bluetoohctl

2- In the bluetooth control shell:
  2.1- Ensure the bluetooth control is powered on:
       power on
  2.2- Turn on and set the default bluetooth agent:
       agent on
       default-agent
  (At this point you'll have to scan for active bluetooth devices, you can either scan with your device off, turn it on and scan for devices again to look for the new device detected, or you can directly scan for devices with the onde you want to use turned on as the shell will probably show the name of the device)
  2.3- Scan for devices:
       scan on
  2.4- Pair the device:
       pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
       --- check if the gamepad connects, with the instructions on the gamepad manual.
(Now out of the bluetooth agent, you have to check if the connection is all right)

3- Check the input device folder on the Raspberry pi:
   ls /dev/input/
   --- you can turn off and on the device to see wich event is the one its mapped to
   --- you can also use cat /dev/input/eventX to see the raw input data generated by the device
(You have to use some other tools to read the raw information into a python script)

4- Install generic input tools:
   sudo apt-get install python-dev
   sudo apt-get install python-pip
   sudo pip install evdev

5- Check device's functionality:
   python /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/evdev/evtest.py
